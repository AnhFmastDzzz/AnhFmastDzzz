## Hi there 👋

😄 WELCOME TO MY PROFILE!

I am Mau Anh, currently majoring in IT major at HCMVNU - UIT. I am highly interested in projects related to education. In the future I would love to create a product that can help any children with any background believe that they are able to learn any subjects at school and can also getting better and apply it to real life.

🔭 At the moment I mostly upload projects for learning how to create a website from Odin Project course and projects that are assignnments from my uni class.
